11.These are the data structures in python
List:-
i) It is represented by comma separated values with in brackets.
ii) list can contain integer, float,strings, tuples and other lists also.
iii)It is mutable means elements can be added and deleted from it.

Tuple:-
i)It is represented by comma separated values within paranthesis.
ii)It can also contain all type of datatypes avilable in python.
iii) It is immutable.

Sets:-
i)It is represented by comma separated values within Curly braces.
ii)It also contain all the type of datatypes  available in python.But it is unordered collection means set do not record element position.
iii)sets are immutable.
iv)Sets have unique elements. this means there is only one particular element in a set.

Dictionary:-

i)It is represented by comma separated key-value pairs within curly braces.
ii)In list index is the adress of the value but in dictionary key is the adress to the respective value.
iii)Keys are unique and immutable.
iv)Dicionary is mutable and values can be duplicate.

12.Strings are not mutable. So replacing '+' sign with space in python is not possible.

13.The ord() function accepts a string of length one as an argument and returns the unicode point representation of the passeed argument. Unicode is a universal character encoding standard.It defines the way indivisual characters are represented in text files, web pages and other types of documents.
ord() function returns  the unicode representation of one lettered string character. The unicode point representation of "A" is 65 and "B" is 66.

The function for getting datadype of of a veriable is-  type()
